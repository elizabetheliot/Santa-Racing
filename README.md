# Santa Racing Application

This application was created for my final project in CS213 - The World Wide Web class. This is a simple car racing game with a Christmas twist. This application was made with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Use the arrow keys to move Santa and avoid the "enemy" cars! If you hit a car, you lose the game. 
 
From developing this game, I have learned a lot about DOM methods, JavaScript functions, and also design. When developing this application, I ran into a few challenges. Initially, when you clicked to start the game, nothing would happen. This was mainly caused by the JavaScript function for starting the game being broken. Another challenge was that the "enemy" cars would not spawn randomly it was supposed to. In order to fix this, I had to utilize Math.random() to have the cars spawn in random locations on the road. My last major challenge was that Santa would not move. I had to add two additional JavaScript functions to fix this (keyUp() and keyDown()). Then, I had to rework other functions to include these new functions. 

To run the project, please upload the files attached into the IDE of your preference, I recommend WebStorm. I used WebStorm to program this application. I also recommend putting all of the files provided into one directory together. 

It should look like this when running:
